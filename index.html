     <h1>My favorite hobby 
    <br>
    Math  
    </h1>
     <p>My favorite hobby is challenging math. Whenever I do math at school, I think of ways to make it more complicating it. I am 9 years old and in 4th grade, but I like doing overgrade math because it is good training for my brain and is very fun to think about. After doing these types of math, I can understand topics better. Anyone who is interested in playing with numbers can do this. Math can keep you busy when you have nothing to do, or it can refresh your brain. Many people enjoy and bring knowledge the world with math. Math makes people smarter and better people. </p>
